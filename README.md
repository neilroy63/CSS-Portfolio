# Overview 

The challenge was to build a portfolio page from sratch (i.e. without an exisitng codebase), which I could add to as the bootcamp progressed.

The idea was to set myself up for future success by applying the core skills recently covered such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.

# Design Decisions 

The architecture was principled on [Semantic HTML.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility)

Bearing this in mind, I concentrated on giving legitimate structure and semantic meaning to the HTML whilst also keeping the code condensed in the CSS stylesheet.

I also made it a point to make the page as accessible and web responsive as possible.

# Issues 

The main issue with the HTML was to ensure proper labelling to correspond with and clearly outline the structure or sections of the page. 

The other main issue was ensuring that the page was reinforced with responsive design as the codebase tended to distort at certain breakpoints.

This was identified and remedied with the help of the media queries.  

# The Stable Default page:

# The Reinforced Page after the implementation of Media Queries to combat distortion:

# Assumptions 

I have assumed that the challenge was purely an exercise in HTML and CSS (and my understanding thus far) without the benefit of any other progamming language(s) such as Javascript.
